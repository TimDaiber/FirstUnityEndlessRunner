#EndlessTD

I have made this Endless Runner game using Unity 5.
Scripts are written in c# on Visual Studio 15
I have made this Game with the help of tutorials from lynda.com and several tutorials on youtube.

MainMenu scene will direct the player t play or exit the game.
When the game starts there is one action button.(AnyKeyDown) 
Which will allw the player to jump over the obstacles that come towards the player.
If the player gets pushed of the scrren by an obstacle the player can restart the game by pressing any key.
Score is measured in how long the player survives the obstacles.
Best time is stored using PlayerPrefs and will remain if the programm is closed.
